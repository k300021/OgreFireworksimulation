CEGUI Unified Editor
=======================
See http://www.cegui.org.uk/wiki/index.php/CEED

Troubleshooting
=======================

1) Can't import ceed.ui.[something]
You haven't got the .ui files compiled.

Compile them with ./maintenance compile-ui-files
or switch to developer mode (see ceed/version.py)

2) Module ceed not found
Unless you have installed ceed system-wide, you have to set several environment
variables so that everything is found correctly.

Go to "bin" and start runwrapper.sh. It will spawn a shell with PYTHONPATH
defined so that "ceed" is found properly.

See the script's contents for more details.
